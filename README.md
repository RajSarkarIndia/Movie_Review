# Movie Review Web Application

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Adding Movie Trailer
- To add a trailer URL in the "Add Movie" form, use an embedded link from YouTube.
- **How to get the embedded code from YouTube:**
  - Go to the YouTube video page of the movie trailer.
  - Click on the **Share** button below the video.
  - Select **Embed** from the popup.
  - Copy the HTML `<iframe>` embed code.
  - From this embed code, extract only the **last part of the link** (the video ID), found after `embed/`.
  
  **Example:**  
  Embed code snippet:  
  `<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" ...></iframe>`  
  Here, only use `dQw4w9WgXcQ` as the Trailer input in the Add Movie form.

### 2. Adding Movie Image
- To add a movie image, place your image file inside the projectâ€™s `/images` folder.
- In the "Add Movie" form, enter the **file name with extension** (e.g., `bahubali.jpg`) into the MovieImageURL field.
- The application will load the image from the `./MovieReview/src/main/webapp/image` folder using that file name.
